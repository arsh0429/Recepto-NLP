# LinkedIn Profile Finder

An AI-powered tool to find and validate LinkedIn profiles based on a persona with hybrid scoring approach.

## 🌟 Features

- Generate a persona from social media profiles (GitHub, Twitter)
- Enrich persona data with People Data Labs API for comprehensive professional details
- Further enhance persona with AI using Google's Gemini model
- Generate optimized LinkedIn search queries based on persona details
- Find and score potential LinkedIn profile matches
- Validate matches with image similarity using CLIP
- Complete profile scoring with weighted matching (name, semantic, location, etc.)
- Streamlit UI for easy interaction

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Persona Creation**: Start with basic information about the person you're looking for (name, social media profiles, professional details)
2. **Profile Enrichment**: Scrape social profiles to gather more details about the person
3. **Professional Data Enrichment**: Use People Data Labs API to fill in professional details, skills, and background
4. **AI Enhancement**: Use Gemini AI to infer additional professional details, skills, and other attributes
5. **Search Query Generation**: Create optimized search queries for LinkedIn
6. **LinkedIn Search**: Find potential matching profiles using SerpAPI
7. **Profile Scoring**: Score each candidate with a hybrid approach:
   - Name similarity using fuzzy matching
   - Semantic similarity of professional descriptions using BERT
   - Industry and location matching
   - Social profile validation
   - Image similarity using CLIP (optional)
8. **Final Ranking**: Combine all scores for a final confidence score
